Ulam Sprial
-----------

A quick implementation of an [Ulam Spiral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral) in Java. The design is based off of 
Stanislaw Ulam's design - a rectangular grid of numbers, starting with 1 at 
the center, and spiraling out:

It outputs an image where each number is represented as a pixel. Black if 
prime and white if composite.
